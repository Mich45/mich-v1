## Introduction
 [`zip()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) is a built-in function in Python used for unpacking values from one or more iterables into a tuple, with one value from each of the iterables in the tuple. Another way of thinking about the `zip` function is transposing a square matrix.

## Syntax
The `zip()` function has the following syntax: 

```python
zip(*iterable, strict=False)
```

- `iterable`: An object that can be looped or iterated over. Examples include strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, etc.
- `strict`:  A boolean value that allows you to set whether the length of the iterables should be the same or not.
- **Return value**: The return value is an iterator of tuples, where the _i_-th tuple contains the _i_-th element from each of the argument iterables. Note that until the zip function is iterated upon, for example, using a **for** loop, or wrapping in a `list()` constructor, the iterables won't be processed or accessible. 

## Understanding the `zip` function through examples

1. Here we're using a **for** loop with the `zip` function to unpack iterables like, a range function, a list, a tuple and a string:

```python
for item in zip(range(4),  ['fee', 'fi', 'fo', 'fum'], ('bam', 'baz', 'bat', 'ban'), 'abot'):  
    print(item)
```

Running the code above prints the following tuples : 
```python
(0, 'fee', 'bam', 'a')
(1, 'fi', 'baz', 'b')
(2, 'fo', 'bat', 'o')
(3, 'fum', 'ban', 't')
```

2. In the following example, we're using the `list()` constructor together with the `zip` function: 

```python
list(zip(range(4),['fee', 'fi', 'fo', 'fum'], ['bam', 'baz', 'bat', 'ban']))
```

The code above outputs:

```python
[(0, 'fee', 'bam'), (1, 'fi', 'baz'), (2, 'fo', 'bat'), (3, 'fum', 'ban')]
```


3. When using the `zip` function, if the `strict` argument is not set to True and the iterables provided are of different lengths, `zip` will only consider the values up to the length of the shortest iterable, ignoring any extra values in the longer iterables. In the example below, the third iterable which is a tuple has a length shorter than other iterables in the function:
 
```python
for item in zip(range(4),  ['fee', 'fi', 'fo', 'fum'], ('bam', 'baz', 'bat'), 'abot'):  
    print(item)
```

And as you can see below, the last item of each of the longer iterables is discarded:

```python
(0, 'fee', 'bam', 'a')
(1, 'fi', 'baz', 'b')
(2, 'fo', 'bat', 'o')
```

4. If you set the value of `strict` to True, and of the iterables passed to the `zip` function has a unequal length, a `ValueError` will be raised.  Here's the code from the last example, but with  `strict=True`:
```python
for item in zip(range(4),  ['fee', 'fi', 'fo', 'fum'], ('bam', 'baz', 'bat'), 'abot', strict=True):  
    print(item)
```

A `ValueError` is thrown as shown below:

```python
(0, 'fee', 'bam', 'a')
(1, 'fi', 'baz', 'b')
(2, 'fo', 'bat', 'o')

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[13], line 1
----> 1 for item in zip(range(4),  ['fee', 'fi', 'fo', 'fum'], ('bam', 'baz', 'bat'), 'abot', strict=True):  
      2 print(item)

ValueError: zip() argument 3 is shorter than arguments 1-2
```


## Tips and tricks for using the `zip` function

### Create a dictionary from two lists
One common use case of the zip function is for creating a dictionary from two lists: 
```python
keys = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
values = ["John", "Jane", "Max", "Dave", "Ella"]

create_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))
print(create_dict) # {0: 'John', 1: 'Jane', 2: 'Max', 3: 'Dave', 4: 'Ella'}
```

### Parallel iteration of two or more lists
Here's how you can use the `zip` function to loop through two or more sequences simultaneously.

```python
users = ['Max', 'Jane', 'Jack']
ages = [25, 30, 25]
for name, age in zip(users, ages):
    print(f'{name} is {age} years old.')

# prints:
# Max is 25 years old.
# Jane is 30 years old.
# Jack is 25 years old.
```

### Using `itertools.zip_longest()` to fill missing values
If one or more of the iterables passed to the `zip` function has a shorter length than others, you can use `itertools.zip_longest()` to fill in the missing values. The example below fills the missing values with 0:

```python
from itertools import zip_longest
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
zipped = list(zip_longest(list1, list2, fillvalue=0))
print(zipped) 

# prints:
# [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd'), (5, 'e'), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)]
```

### Unzip a sequence using the * operator 
Perhaps you have been wondering if there's an `unzip` function that does the the opposite of `zip`, well, there's none. You can actually use the `zip` function to zip and unzip a sequence of iterables. 

The example below shows how you can use the `*` operator with `zip` to unzip a list of tuples into separate tuples:

```python
zipped = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4)]
letters, numbers = zip(*zipped)
print(letters)
print(numbers)

# prints:
# ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
# (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

## Conclusion
`zip` is a very handy function every Python developer should have in their arsenal. Its versatility can help make your code look more readable and professional. 

Hopefully, this article has shed light on the potentials of `zip` and equipped you with valuable tips to leverage its capabilities in your next projects.

Until next time, happy coding!
