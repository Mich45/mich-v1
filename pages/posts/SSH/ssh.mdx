tags: [cloud, webdev, tutorial]
excerpt: "SSH (Secure Shell) is a fundamental tool in computer networking that allows two or more computers to communicate securely over a network. It was originally developed by Finnish researcher Tatu Yl√∂nen, in response to a password-sniffing attack on his university's network in the summer of 1995."

## Introduction

### Step 1 - Initialize Next.js project

I'm assuming you already have a NextJS project initialized, if you don't, you can run the following command to start a new NextJS project:

```bash
npx create-next-app tailwind-next

# or with Yarn

yarn create next-app tailwind-next
```

### Step 2 - Install TailwindCSS

The next step is to install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal to do so:

```bash
npm i tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer -D

# with Yarn

yarn add tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer -D

```
